# Case Harvester
Case Harvester is a project designed to mine the [Maryland Judiciary Case Search](http://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/casesearch/inquiry-index.jsp) (MJCS) and build a near-complete database of Maryland court cases that can be queried and analyzed without the limitations of the MJCS interface. It is designed to leverage [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) for scalability and performance.

> **NOTE: Unless you are modifying Case Harvester for specific purposes, please do not run your own instance so that MJCS is spared unneccesary load. If you are a values-aligned researcher or journalist, you are welcome to access our public case database scraped from MJCS with defendant information redacted; reach out to us at [dan@acabenterprises.net](mailto:dan@acabenterprises.net).**

# Architecture
Case Harvester is split into three main components: spider, scraper, and parser. Each component is a part of a pipeline that finds, downloads, and parses case data from the MJCS. The following diagram shows at a high level how each of these components interact:

### Spider
The spider component is responsible for discovering case numbers. It does this by submitting search queries to the MJCS and iterating through the results. Because the MJCS only returns a maximum of 500 results, the search algorithm splits queries that return 500 results into a set of more narrowed queries which are then submitted. Each of these queries is then split again if more than 500 results are returned, and so forth, until the MJCS is exhaustively searched for case numbers. Each discovered case number is submitted to a PostgreSQL database, and then added to a queue for scraping:

### Scraper
The scraper component downloads and stores the case details for every case number discovered by the spider. The full HTML for each case ([example](http://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/casesearch/inquiryDetail.jis?caseId=116090001&loc=69&detailLoc=DSK8)) is added to an S3 bucket. Version information is kept for each case, including a timestamp of when each version was downloaded, so changes to a case can be recorded and referenced.

The scraper is a [Lambda function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) that runs once an hour, as well as when the scraper queue has items in it. When the scraper is initially invoked by one of these triggers, it spawns a limited number of worker functions which can each scrape up to 10 cases from the queue. Each of the worker functions spawns another worker function upon completion, until the scraper queue is empty. The scraper is configured to spawn usually 1-2 concurrent worker functions, in order to limit the load on the MJCS.

### Parser
The parser component is another Lambda function that parses the case details from the HTML for each case, and stores those in the PostgreSQL database. Each new item added to the scraper S3 bucket spawns a new parser function, which allows for significant scaling.

Case details in the MJCS are displayed differently depending on the county and type of case (e.g. district vs circuit court, criminal vs civil, etc.). MJCS assigns a code to each of these different case types, which can be thought of as schemas for rendering case details. Case Harvester currently has [parsers](src/mjcs/parser) for the following schemas:
* CC: Circuit court civil cases (Baltimore City)
* DSCIVIL: District court civil cases (Baltimore City)
* DSCR: District court criminal cases (Baltimore City)
* DSK8: Circuit court criminal cases (Baltimore City)
* ODYCRIM: Criminal cases (outside Baltimore City)
* ODYTRAF: Traffic cases (outside Baltimore City)

Each different parser breaks down the case details to a granular level and stores the data in a number of database tables. This [schematic diagram](https://disman.tl/caseharvester/relationships.html) illustrates how this data is represented in the database.

# Installation
Case Harvester can be run or deployed from any workstation running Python 3, [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). The required Python 3 modules are in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

Next, configure AWS CLI with `aws configure` so that it can deploy Case Harvester. Here you'll use an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key either for your root AWS account, or an IAM user or role that has sufficient permissions.

## Deploy to AWS
Case Harvester uses [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) stacks to deploy, configure, and connect all of the needed AWS resources. There are separate stacks for static resources (VPC, S3 bucket, RDS instance), spider, scraper, and parser. The first step is to set strong, unique passwords for the database users in `secrets.json`:

```
{
  "development":{
    "DatabaseMasterUsername":"root",
    "DatabaseMasterPassword":"badpassword",
    "DatabaseUsername":"db_user",
    "DatabasePassword":"badpassword",
    "DatabaseReadOnlyUsername":"ro_user",
    "DatabaseReadOnlyPassword":"badpassword"
  },
  "production":{
    "DatabaseMasterUsername":"root",
    "DatabaseMasterPassword":"badpassword",
    "DatabaseUsername":"db_user",
    "DatabasePassword":"badpassword",
    "DatabaseReadOnlyUsername":"ro_user",
    "DatabaseReadOnlyPassword":"badpassword"
  }
}
```

You can then deploy the cloudformation stacks to AWS by running:

```
make deploy
```

Once this is finished, you can intialize the database and configure Case Harvester to use the newly deployed resources by running:

```
make init
```

Note that the above commands deploy and initialize a development environment. To deploy to a production environment:

```
make deploy_production
make init_production
```

More make targets (such as deploying a specific stack or generating documentation) can be found by looking in the [`Makefile`](Makefile).

# Usage
The default deployment of Case Harvester sets up the scraper and parser to automatically run when new case numbers are submitted by the spider. The spider can be run from any workstation, though for convenience it is usually run on an EC2 instance since the search process can take a long time.

Run the spider by specifying a search time range and county:
```
./src/case_harvester.py spider --start-date 1/1/2000 --end-date 12/31/2000 --county 'BALTIMORE CITY'
```

By default, `case_harvester.py` runs in your development AWS environment (see [Deploy to AWS](#deploy-to-aws)). To run in your production environment, add the `--environment production` CLI flag:

```
./src/case_harvester.py spider --environment production -s 1/1/2000 -e 12/31/2000 --county 'BALTIMORE CITY'
```
